        <h4>Local creators, whose hands are part of every process of making their goods, produce many of the objects we carry. 

            The seasonal flowers we use in our arrangements are grown in and around Philadelphia at small farms, and are harvested and delivered to us by the same farmers who planted the seeds. </h4>
