        <h4>Falls Flowers was the first floral-retail and event design studio to work sustainably and Vault + Vine aims to continue that legacy. We strive to do what a good business should do: support our community, buy and source locally, pay our employees well, and follow high standards of sustainability. </h4>

        <h4>Through volunteerism, financial support, involvement in community groups, and providing a safe space for all to gather, we aim to provide the best of what the world has to offer to you. We do this by working with our suppliers and vendors to hold ourselves to higher standards. </h4>
